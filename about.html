        <h1 class="">Why focus on Problem Gambling?</h1>
        <p>Gambling has been around for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians crafted twenty-sided dice and Romans held chariot races that generated large amounts of betting. Gambling was seen as religious and ceremonial function that slowly became a recreational
          activity. A look at history in the United States would reveal the expansion of gambling has been followed by corruption, regulation and prohibition.</p>
        <p> Experts believe there were three waves of gambling in the U.S. -- establishing the colonies with lotteries; traveling west for the gold rush; and Nevada legalizing casinos during the Great Depression. Despite the challenges gambling has had in
          the past, today it has grown to become $100 billion commercial enterprise with gambling opportunities available in every state except Utah and Hawaii.</p>
        <p> People can gamble on riverboats, in casinos and on international airline flights. Problem gamblers now can use the internet to bet on bingo, casino games and sporting events from the convenience and privacy of their home computer, cell phone or
          IPad. Gambling can be done legally at casinos, but a large amount of gambling can be done illegally either due to the lack of resources to enforce the laws, the inability to regulate the types of gambling activity or arguments that the games
          are not even gambling.</p>
        <p> Gambling, such as video poker, has emerged in bars, truck stops and supermarkets. The legal payout in North Carolina is a small dollar amount in the form of a coupon. Many establishments are taking in and paying out large sums of money illegally.
          Sweepstakes parlors have also emerged in rural and urban communities across North Carolina making millions utilizing software which was once illegal, but now is held up in the North Carolina Supreme Court by a sweepstakes software industry appeal
          to the original ruling. Many parlors have altered their games stating they are not offering gambling, but are instead providing a product that is a game of skill. It is important to note that video poker providers and sweepstakes parlor owners
          do not advertise the NCGPG Helpline nor do they fund any treatment or prevention services.</p>
        <p> The rapid expansion and universal cultural acceptance of the media-glamorized commercial gambling industry has led to parents and children gambling together with little to no awareness of problem gambling as an addiction. Many do not even view
          it as a possible harmful activity. A 1999 Gallup Poll found that two-thirds of American adults approve of legalized gambling. It is a source of revenue for states and charities and is viewed as an economic generator for local communities. Research
          indicates children are engaging in gambling activities earlier than they are with drug or alcohol use. Similar to substance abuse, research also shows that parents with a gambling problem often have children with a gambling problem.</p>
        <p>
        The National Council on Problem Gambling reports that 2 million (1%) of U.S. adults are estimated to be pathological gamblers in a given year. Another 4-6 million (2-3%) would be considered problem gamblers not meeting the full criteria for pathological
          gambling, but are experiencing problems due to their gambling. Higher prevalence rates are found in those people in their teens and twenties. Even further, minorities and active duty military in their teens and twenties and veterans and senior
          citizens have even higher prevalence rates. Yet, not every state provides treatment or prevention services.</p>
        <p> North Carolina began providing prevention and treatment services in the area of problem gambling as a legislative mandate when the North Carolina Education lottery was created in 2005. Since the inception of the problem gambling program, thousands
          of problem gambling calls have been made to the helpline and thousands of teens and young adults have been exposed to prevention programs in middle schools, high schools and college and university campuses across the state. With ongoing material
          distribution and upcoming education and outreach endeavors, the NCPGP is dedicated to building awareness for what has been dubbed the “hidden addiction.”</p>
        <p> Looking ahead, several authorities on the subject of the expansion of gambling have speculated the fourth wave is now the rapid expansion of unregulated online gambling. More recently, DraftKings and FanDuel, the two leaders in online fantasy
          sports, have been defending their existence and dealing with many legal challenges stating their product is a game of skill and not gambling. In addition, many companies are poising for the US Supreme Court to lift the ban on sports betting
          due to arguments being made currently in the New Jersey Supreme Court. This area of problem gambling research is certainly in its infancy and needs further exploration. </p>
